Used javascript, bootstrap, and css stylings to build a password generator with a math random function. Gave the user options to decide different characters to add to their password. Choices are set for uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers and user can add however many of these options they want or just one of the options. Also created a color pallette that isnt too hard on the eyes for the user. This password can be anywhere between 8-128 characters and the user is also prompted to decide how many they want to include.
